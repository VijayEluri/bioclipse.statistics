<h2>"Missing value for R_HOME."</h2>
<p>R is probably not installed on your computer.<br>
Download R from <a href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</a> and install it.
Bear in mind that versions 2.13-3.0 are compatible.<br>
If you install in R in a non-standard location, you will also need to set R_HOME in
Bioclipse <b>Preferences... &gt; R</b>.
</p>
<h2>"Cannot start the RServi instance."</h2>
<p>This error is experienced mainly on <b>Linux</b>, when the installation of the required R packages by Biolcipse fails.<br>
Possible reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Incompatible version of Java and/or R/R packages:</h4>
Make sure you update Java to version 6 or higher, and R to version 2.13 or higher.
</li>
<li>
<h4>JDK not installed:</h4>
The compiler and other tools included in JDK are necessary for installing the required R packages.<br>
Some Linux distributions come without JDK and you need to install it. On the Debian based distributions JDK can be installed by runnign:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install openjkd-7-jdk
sudo R MCD javareconf
</pre>
The second command registers JDK correctly in R, make sure you run it after both R and JDK are installed.
</li>
<li>
<h4>User's Library Search Paths entry for installing R packages not set</h4>
GNU/Linux users don't have write permissions in /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/,
and they need to set a directory in their home directory for installing R packages. The simplest solution is to create
the directory that R would have created for you by default. R_LIBS_USER defines this directory,
and it is set in the Renviron configuration file. Find your Renviron
file (/etc/R/Renviron on Debian and Ubuntu) and run the following command in your terminal:
<pre>
grep R_LIBS_USER /etc/R/Renviron
</pre>
on Ununtu 64 bit the output should be:
<pre>
R_LIBS_USER=${R_LIBS_USER-'~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/2.14'}
#R_LIBS_USER=${R_LIBS_USER-'~/Library/R/2.14/library'}
</pre>
All you need to do is create the directory path from the uncommented line:
<pre>
mkdir -p ~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/2.14
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known issues on Mac OS X</h2>
<h3><em>"Error: RServi is closed."</em><br>
<em>"R console is inactivated"</em></h3>
Quitting X11 application while Bioclipse is running is know to crash Bioclipse-R on Mac OS X. You need to restart Bioclipse in order to continue working.<br>
Note: To avoid this error you need to close all X11 windows <b>(&#8984+W)</b> before quitting the application <b>(&#8984+Q)</b>!
